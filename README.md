Audio FFT with Processing.js
============================

This is an example application that uses the Spotify app SDK to access the realtime audio data. A simple visualisation is generated using Processing.js. As the [Spotify boilerplate application](https://github.com/spotify/boilerplate-app) was used as a starting point, the notes below are adapted from the boilerplate notes.

To test the application your Spotify account needs to have the developer flag
set. You can find out how to activate the developer flag [here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer-account).

Clone this repository in your Spotify workspace directory. If you haven't got a Spotify directory, read about where to create it [here](http://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/developer/#creatinganapp). Cloning will create a subfolder called boilerplate-app. 

You can access the application (restart the Spotify desktop client if you have not done so) by typing in spotify:app:audio-fft-processing in the search field.
